            <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to structure web pages.
 It is used to create various elements of a webpage/website such as nav-bar, paragraphs, images, video, forms, and more, which are displayed in a web browser.
 HTML uses tags to create elements of a webpage. It was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990 for sharing documents over the Internet.
 HTML is a markup language, not a programming language. This means it annotates text to define how it is structured and displayed by web browsers</p>
